Forked from Esx Paintball by @EagleOne 


Mod that adds paintball activity to your QB server.
Players must empty their inventory and remove their weapons. Otherwise the inventory will be LOST.
The teleporter is at the prison and the land is not far away.
to change the teleporter, change the coordinates of home and homeblip to the new location in the client/main.lua file.
By choosing the team, the player changes skin and becomes in first person. If he leaves the field he returns to civilian clothes.

You must add these resources to your server.cfg for the resource to work.

start qb-paintball
start InteractSound

You can do whatever you want with the resource edit, share etc.

Goodluck on the paintball field!
